	<LongDescription>## Magic Garbage Truck [MGT]

### Updated for 1.3.6* and Bridges DLC

This mod removes the need to place garbage handling buildings in your city.

---

### Option 1: Total Magic
- Instantly removes all garbage as soon as it appears.
- Just set it and forget it! (like traditional magic garbage)
- Trucks and buildings are purely cosmetic.

---

### Option 2: Semi-Magic
- "Magic Slider" to greatly increase garbage truck capacity (100-500%)
- Over-powered super trucks reduce traffic and service strain.
- Great for players who still want to see trucks driving around.

---

### Compatibility
- This mod works with new and existing saves; safe to remove at any time.
- Does not use Harmony or Reflection; lightweight, compatible, and less likely to break with game updates.
