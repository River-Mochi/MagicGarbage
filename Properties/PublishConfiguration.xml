	<LongDescription>## Magic Garbage Truck [MGT]

### Updated for 1.3.6* and Bridges DLC

Handle garbage your way:
- **Total Magic** option removes the need for any garbage buildings or trucks.
- **Semi-Magic** option increases garbage truck capacity to improve service and reduce traffic.

---

### How it works

**OPTION 1 - TOTAL MAGIC**
- ✅ Magic Garbage on, removes all garbage instantly.
- Perfect if you want to forget about all garbage buildings.
- Set it and forget it! (most like classic old "magical garbage")
- No garbage issues; trucks and facilities are cosmetic now.

**OPTION 2 - SEMI-MAGIC (SUPER TRUCKS)**
- Magic Garbage = OFF
- Use the slider to increase garbage truck capacity [100>>500%].
- 🚚 Super powered trucks reduce traffic and service strain.
- Great if you still want to see trucks driving around, just fewer problems.
- Bonus: unload speed scales with capacity change. Facilities won't clog with mega truck unloads taking longer.

Do Option 1 or 2, not both (nothing bad will happen, it just won't do anything extra).

**OPTION 3 - NO MAGIC (Vanilla)**
- For cities where you want vanilla gameplay, you don't need to uninstall.
- Just uncheck the magic box[ ], set slider = 100%. Enjoy a normal game.

### Supports 6 languages
* English, Français French, Deutsch German, Español Spanish, Italiano Italian
* 简体中文 Simplified Chinese

---

### Compatibility
- Safe to remove at any time; works with new and existing cities.
- Does not use Harmony or Reflection; lightweight, compatible, and less likely to break with game updates.
