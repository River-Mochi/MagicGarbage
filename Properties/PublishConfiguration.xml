**Magic Garbage Truck [MGT]**


Handle garbage your way:
- **Total Magic** option cleans all city garbage.
- **Semi-Magic** option lets you tune all garbage trucks and facilities.

---

### How it works

**OPTION 1  AUTO CLEAN**
- ✅ Total Magic on, removes all garbage instantly.
- Perfect if you want to forget about all garbage.
- Set it and forget it! (most like classic old "magical garbage")
- No garbage issues; trucks and facilities become mostly cosmetic.

**OPTION 2  SELF-MANAGE**
- ✅ Semi-Magic on; manage how you like.
- **Sliders** to control all garbage trucks/facilities
- 🚚 Super powered trucks reduce traffic and service strain.
- Great if you still want to see trucks driving around, just fewer problems.
- **Helper buttons**
  - [Game Defaults]	reset all sliders to 100% (pure vanilla).  
  - [Recommended]	presets for % load, truck count, process speed, storage max.

**OPTION 3  NO MAGIC** (vanilla)
- Turn Semi-Magic on ✅, Click [Game Defaults]
- All sliders at 100% = exactly standard gameplay.

### Compatibility
- Works with new and existing cities. Enable/Disable any time, safely remove any time.
- Does not use Harmony or Reflection; lightweight, compatible, and less likely to break with game updates.
