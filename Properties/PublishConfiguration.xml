	<LongDescription>## Magic Garbage Truck

### Updated for 1.3.6* and Bridges DLC

This mod removes the need to place garbage handling buildings in your city.

### Option 1: Total Magic
- All garbage is instantly removed from the city as soon as it is generated.
- Just set it and forget it! (like traditional magic garbage)
- Trucks and buildings are purely cosmetic.

### Option 2: Semi-Magic
- Magic Slider to greatly increase capacity of Super Trucks.
- Choice for players who like to see some garbage trucks driving around.
- Over-powered garbage services to reduce traffic and garbage buildup.

### Compatibility
- This mod works with new and existing saves; safe to remove at any time.
- Does not use Harmony or Reflection; lightweight, compatible, and less likely to break with game updates.

### Credits
- RiverMochi - author and maintainer
- Thanks to Wayz for inspiration on the original Magical Garbage mod
- Necko1996 - testing
