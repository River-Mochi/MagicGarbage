# Magic Garbage Truck [MGT]

## Two ways to handle garbage in **Cities: Skylines II**

## Option 1 – Total Magic (Auto Clean)

- ✅ **Total Magic ON**
- All city garbage is removed almost instantly.
- No garbage micromanagement – just build your city.
- Garbage warning icons are cleared because there is no garbage.
- Garbage trucks and buildings become mostly cosmetic.

## Option 2 – Semi-Magic (Self-Manage)

- ✅ **Semi-Magic ON**, **Total Magic OFF**.
- Vanilla garbage simulation stays active, but you control all stats:
  - **Truck load capacity** (100–500%)
  - **Facility truck count** (100–400%)
  - **Processing speed** (100–500%)
  - **Facility storage capacity** (100–500%)
- Two helper buttons:
  - **Game Defaults** – puts everything back to **100%** (pure vanilla behaviour).
  - **Recommended** – 200% truck load, 150% truck count, 200% processing speed, 150% storage.

> 💡 Choose **Total Magic** *or* **Semi-Magic**.  
> You can swap between them any time; the UI makes it clear what’s active.

## Compatibility

- Works with new and existing saves.
- Safe to remove or disable at any time.
- Does **not** use Harmony or reflection – lightweight and resilient to game updates.
