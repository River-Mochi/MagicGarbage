# Magic Garbage Truck [MGT]

## Two ways to handle garbage in **Cities: Skylines II**

## 1. Total Magic
- Completely removes garbage - set and forget.
- Buildings never pile up garbage.
- Garbage warning icons are reset automatically.
- Garbage trucks and facilities become purely cosmetic.

## 2. Semi-Magic (Super Trucks)
- Vanilla garbage simulation stays active.
- “Super-truck” slider (100–500%) to increase truck capacity.
  - Unload speed scales with capacity so depots don’t clog.
  - More truck capacity means less traffic and reduced need for trucks.
- Optional toggle to hide vanilla garbage warning icons.

## Compatibility
- Safe to remove or disable any time; Works with new and existing saves.  
- Just remember that turning off **Total Magic** means vanilla garbage will start accumulating again.
- Go vanilla or use Super Truck Slider.
