# Magic Garbage Truck [MGT]

## Two ways to handle garbage in **Cities: Skylines II**

## Option 1 Total Magic (recommended default)

- ✅ Magic Garbage on
- All city garbage is removed instantly.
- No garbage micromanagement. Just build your city and ignore garbage.
- Auto disables garbage warning icons because there is no garbage
- Garbage trucks and buildings are purely cosmetic.
- Closest to the classic defunct "Magical Garbage Truck" mod.

## Option 2 Semi-Magic (🚚 Super Trucks)
- Turn **Magic Garbage = OFF**.
- Use the **Garbage Truck Capacity** slider (**100–500%**) to make super-size trucks.
- Vanilla garbage simulation stays active.
  - Each truck carries more garbage so fewer trucks are needed.
  - Unload speed scales with capacity so depots don’t clog.

> 💡 Do Option 1 or 2 – not both.  
> Nothing breaks if you mix them, but you won’t gain anything extra.

## Compatibility
- Works with new and existing saves.
- Safe to remove or disable at any time; 
- This does not use Harmony or Reflection - lightweight and less likely to break with game updates.
